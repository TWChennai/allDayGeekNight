        description: "I am someone who is always doing something. I like doing stuff as long as it interests me. If I lose my interest, its time to take up something new. This is one of the main reasons I love coding, designing and developing. There's always something new to pick up and learn. I don't aim to be the best coz then there will be no one to set my sights on. But I will always give my best. I am also a very quick learner, I'm curious, objective and will not take anything at face value. All in all, I'm a fun loving guy who always manages to find the fun in everything I do."
